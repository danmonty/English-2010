                    Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) is infamously known as the nerdy game of the century. Unfortunately, many people don’t know much 
                    about what DnD actually is or how it is played. Dungeons and Dragons is a Role Playing Game (RPG) but should not be confused 
                    for LARPing (live action role playing). It is a tabletop game where the players get to completely customize their characters. 
                    The characters can be silly, ridiculous, or serious. They can be stupid and strong or wise and charismatic. It is all dependent 
                    on what the creator wants to do.
                </p>

                    Players’ characters have six main stats which the game is based off of: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, 
                    Wisdom, and Charisma. Pop culture has related all of the skills to a tomato to help people to understand what they do. 
                    Strength is how hard you can throw a tomato. Dexterity is how accurate you can throw the tomato. Constitution is being able 
                    to eat a rotten tomato. Intelligence is knowing that a tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing that you shouldn’t put tomatoes in 
                    fruit salads. Charisma is convincing people to buy a fruit salad that has tomatoes in it.

                    To play DnD, there needs to be a narrator type person. Game terminology terms them as Dungeon Master, shortened to DM. The DM 
                    is the person telling the story. They can use a prebuilt, buyable quest, or they can make their own. The job of the DM is to 
                    make the game, fun, challenging, yet doable. The DM needs to make sure that the characters are not guaranteed to win, and that 
                    they have a chance of dying. They play as non-player characters, which includes the villager, villains, henchmen, and God of that little 
                    world. Anything is possible with a flexible DM. All experienced DnD players live by the saying, “What DM says, goes”.

                    DnD is not the only RPG. Many games have since been made that are in the popular style. There are DnD knock offs which can be 
                    Sci Fi based instead of Fantasy. Some take place in the future and others are about superheros. In the more recent years, 
                    lots of video games have been made in the similar RPG style. But in my opinion, DnD is the best. DnD isn’t only for the gross 
                    looking awkward geeks. DnD can be played by anyone. If you want to start, buy a Player’s Handbook and find a group to play 
                    with. But be forewarned, although all DnD players might not be 100% geeks with no social skills, almost all players are nerds!
