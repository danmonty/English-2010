                    Many people see one side of Dungeons and Dragons in Stranger Things, "Episode One: The Vanishing Boy" when Mike lets slip to his mom that he and his friends have been playing for ten hours. To the Mr. Average Joe, this can seem like a lot of time spent playing a silly game. It is. However, D&D sessions can go for a long time. I know people who will not meet for a session unless it is at least 4 hours long. Usually they like them longer. But us nerds playing D&D, no matter how in depth role-playing we get, don’t stop being (completely) human. We still have humans needs, the most important one being food.            </p>

                    I think that part of it is the culture that if a group of people meet up, they eat food. The other part of this is probably because the group of players’ characters is called the party, and all great parties have food! But what to bring. Sometimes you don’t know if you’ll be playing for four hours or 9 hours. What will you ever do?

                    In my opinion, I think that all people in the group should contribute to the food cause. Usually I find it the role for the host (usually the DM) to have some sort of main course. Pizza is a great idea for this but can get old fast. If you are doing a longer session, maybe consider going out to eat for 45 minutes.

                    The next common food is usually something like cookies. They aren’t messy and everyone loves them. However, sweets can get old. Sometimes you just need something more. I decided to take grapes. At first my friends were somewhat confused, but halfway through the session, all the grapes were gone. I told my friends, "My mom always tells me, 'People will get sick of desserts for snacks. Take fruit instead.'" Another good idea to counter the sweets is popcorn. It is cheap and easy to microwave.

                    Before going to your next D&D session I would like you to consider what type of food to bring. Basic sweet? Or sophisticated snacks?            </p>
