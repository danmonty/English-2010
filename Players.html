            <p1 class="title">Dear D&D Players</p1>
            <p>
                By the time you are reading this, hopefully, you have discovered the fact that Dungeons and Dragons is a great game. It smiths friendships and crafts enchanting memories. It is a true form of choice, letting the players play how they want to. I think that D&D is great, but the important part isn’t building the best characters because you abuse the system. It is about you: the player.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the course of the website, I have tried to create a story arc starting on the best characters classes, slowly moving towards the idea the better characters are only created by being a better player. 
            </p>
            <p>
                What do I mean? You can have a crappy character: awful stats, huge flaws, and altogether quite weak. This doesn’t mean that you need to make a new character. Mary Sue’s are not meant to be the only characters. The best characters to play are the characters who occasionally suck. It makes you, as a player, play more creatively. It can also lead to hilarious encounters or miraculous rescues. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my friends had a talent at making such characters. A useless dwarven druid, a crazy, crippled half-orc, and even a half-celestial, whom all sucked. It didn’t matter that he wasn’t the highest damage dealer or the healing cleric. He still had fun, and made the game fun!
            </p>
            <p>
                If keep finding that you aren’t having fun in your sessions, people never like (or love) your characters, or you seems not to fit like the well oiled gear, it might be your fault. Don’t get me wrong, if your characters are always the pits and are causing the party to fail over and over again, consider improving your character building skill. But here are some suggestions for you as a player to play better and to have more fun.            </p>
            <p>
                If you are nit-picky about every single rule and word, STOP! Like seriously. D&D is not a courtroom. You are not a lawyer. The DM is not the judge. Your party is not the jury. Following the rules in important, but playing and having fun is more important. And your session is not a democracy. It is a dictatorship lead by the Dungeon Master, clean and simple.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please, please, PLEASE, play your character. You need to be true to who you created. Examples? Your alignment is Lawful Good. You can’t go around stealing and murdering willy-nilly. You can’t stand being insulted? Make your stubborn half-orc stand up for his honor. It might not always lead to the angerment of the monarchy who will imprison you and you party … anyways
            </p>
            <p>
                D&D is not about winning. Approximately 104% of people who find out I play D&D ask, “So, uh . . . how does one win D&D?” I always tell them that you really can’t win D&D, but you complete quests which can almost be equated with winning. You, as a player, are the key to playing D&D, not your fictional character who’s just some graphite and paper.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sincerely, A Friend,
