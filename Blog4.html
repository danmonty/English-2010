            <p>
                Why is sorcerer my favorite heavy-magic class when most people don't like them? The main reason that I decided to try out the sorcerer is becuase my friend wanted to run a high-level D&D campaign. I saw that at level 14, the Dragonic Bloodline Sorcerer got the ability to sprout wings and fly. Who wouldn't want that?
            </p>
            <p>
                Ever since that point, I just had a inate passion for sorcerers. I think that the Dragonic Blood line helps the sorcerer suck a little less as well. Why? The subclass gives more Hit Points and gives a natural armor rating of minimum 13. This can be really nice since those are the biggest downfalls of being a magic user.

                Sorcerers also have sorcerery points, letting them cast magic more effiectly, safley, or even just more. It makes the spells do more damage (or other effects) a lot more usful because they are doing more with less. Come on, just play a sorcerer!
