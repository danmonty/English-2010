                Interested in learning more about Dungeons and Dragons? Curious to see if you have what it takes to become a fearless adventurer? Are you a seasoned 
                dungeon delver who is interested is looking for some small hints or tricks to making your next session successful? Well you have come to the right place. 
                This site is dedicated to discussing anything from bring snacks to sessions to dispeling any myths about D&D. Why the latter? False beliefs alienate us. 
                The biggest: we are all nerds/geeks. Most of us are, but is isn't contagious. Yes, I’ll admit that I’m a ginormous nerd. I love Harry Potter, Star Trek,
                 Star Wars (which isn’t as good as Star Trek),  Pokemon, and more. Anyways...

                My name is Dan Monty. I started playing D&D around the summer of 2016. I have played homebrew and prebuilt quests; I have been the DM (story teller/villains) before for some friends. I love
                 to play D&D. When I first started playing, I was lost and confused. My first character was a wizard, but choosing a magic class for the first time
                  player is a giant mistake. I want to help new players not make the same mistakes, and I want to help some of the more experienced players learn how to 
                  continue to be good players. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Face your fears, whether it be an evil necromancer or an adult red dragon. I hope that you continue to stay tuned and keep on adventuring!
