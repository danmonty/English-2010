                    Interested in learning more about Dungeons and Dragons? Curious to see if you have what it takes to become a fearless adventurer? Are you a seasoned dungeon delver who wants some hints or tricks to create the best character? Well you have come to the right place. This site is dedicated to discussing anything D&D.             </p>
            <p>
                My name is Danny Montel. I started playing D&D around the summer of 2016. I have played homebrew and prebuilt quests; I have even DM a few times, and I love D&D. When I first started playing, I was lost and confused. My first character was a wizard; choosing a magic class for the first time player is a giant mistake. I want to help new players not make the same mistakes. I also want to help some of the more experienced players learn how to continue to be good players. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Face your fears, whether it be an evil necromancer or an adult red dragon. I hope that you continue to stay tuned and keep on adventuring!
