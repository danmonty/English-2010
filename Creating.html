                My older brother introduced me to Dungeons and Dragons. He wanted to try being the Dungeon Master and needed some test subjects: my cousin and I, some of his first victims. He printed off character sheets for us and gave us the Player’s Handbook and told us to start reading and following the instructions it gives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Erubadhron, known as Eru only to those he considered his closest friends and worse enemies,  was my first creation. I was a forest-gnome wizard. This was my first great mistake. First of all, magic is complicated to any novice. There are spell lists and spell components and schools of magic and arcane or divine focuses and ritual spell tags. Magic wasn’t the only issue: I didn’t understand Initiative, Saving Rolls, Attack Rolls, Damage Rolls, Hit Die or the difference between them and my Hit Points. What gave me such complications to an otherwise simple task? I had no experience in making characters or playing D&D.             
            </p>
            <p>
                This leads to my second and third great mistakes: at that point in time, I didn’t completely read any of the Player’s Handbook; and I didn’t understand most of D&D. I used Eru for about 2 sessions when I realized my ignorance created too many blunders with his making, so I decided to start my collection of failed characters—holding onto false hope that one day I will remake him.

                You may find yourself in a similar pinch that I was in. You may just have an unfortunate lack of talent for creating good, fun characters. If so, this article is here to help. However, this is not step by step for  making a D&D character: rather, a few tips and tricks to transform poor or good characters into great characters.             </p>
            <p1>
                Step One: Basic is Okay
            </p1>
            <p>
                According to a Wizards of the Coast (producers of D&D) survey, Human Fighters are the most played. Yes, it’s simple, that’s the point. This I push for the beginner players, mostly because it can start them off and give them invaluable experience. Races I suggest for beginners—although it isn’t as influential as classes—would be Elves or Dwarfs. Another suggestion for keeping it basic is to avoid heavy magic classes. Clerics, Druids, Sorcerers, Warlocks, and Wizards should probably be avoided just because magic is complex. The concept of magic and all it includes makes creating characters more difficult, along with choosing and reading up on spells which also complicates characters. Remember to keep it basic.            </p>
            <p1>
                Step Two: Make them Unique
            </p1>
            <p>
                The best way to create and play a great character—besides with keeping true to your character—is to make them memorable. One way to do this is to make them unique. Don’t be too basic. Don’t copy and paste, making paper dolls. The characters you make can be an extension of you. Making characters unique can be difficult because there isn’t a formula for making characters unique. That would make them non-unique. However, to the amatuer  here are some suggestions: have an interesting backstory; have serious or strange flaws, ideals, or bonds; have a defining physical trait; if you are role playing more in depth, try having a fun voice. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Sola Lureo was a strong-willed, speak before you think, kind of Rock Gnome. She ended with the other failed characters eventually because she died at the fault of the DM, but while we were alive, it was fun to be sassy, even if that got us in some trouble. Do keep one thing to keep in the back of your mind: make a character that you will be able to play. Don’t make them too ridiculous.
            </p>
            <p1>
                Step Three: Talk to your Dungeon Master
            </p1>
            <p>
                I give this suggestion twofold. First, usually the DM will have more experience then the beginners. They will have insight that you might not have if you are a new player. The second reason being, they can help you keep (or break...shhh) the rules, and they won’t be too surprised when you present a crazy (like multiclassing 7 times) character or use some obscure ability. Also by doing this they can help integrate characters into the campaign, which helps game flow and keeps interests high.
            </p>
            <p1>
                Step Four: Make them Applicable
            </p1>
            <p>
                This goes along with step three. The best characters are characters that are playable and useful. If the quest you will be questing through swamps and forests, don’t make a character that specializes in frozen tundras. If the main bad guy is resistant or immune to all piercing and slashing damage, a barbarian or fighter may not be the most useful. Now I don’t want you to create the perfect character, aka the Mary Sue. Mary Sue characters are perfect. The have beautiful skin, flaxen hair, and deep entrancing eyes. Their flaws are being too perfect or kind. These characters (while fun one in a donzen) can get boring to play.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another character I made, whose final resting place is in my collection of failed characters, failed because I chose the wrong class for the campaign. His name as Kaens; Kaens was a High-Elf rogue. He didn’t fail because he was too basic or not unique enough—he was raised by wolves. He failed because Rogues flourish in dark dungeons and small city alleyways, not in a swampy marshland.
            </p>
            <p1>
                Step Five: Know your Character
            </p1>
            <p>
                When making a character, you should keep in mind that you will need to be playing this character. Make sure while creating your backstory, ideals, flaws, and bonds that you remember why. These are critical to role playing. The Folk Hero is going to treat villagers differently then the Bounty Hunter. Also know your characters abilities, actions, and options. Although D&D sessions can on average range from 4-8 hours, nobody wants to wait for you to flip through the Player’s Handbook looking for what your <i>Action Surge</i> does or what effects you can cast with <i>Prestidigitation</i>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I myself, am working to be better at this. I like to try to play strategy and use obscure rules or side effects to change the game. While it makes it fun to play differently from whacking and bashing, it can be a bit tedious for the other players to watch me thumb through the rule book. The biggest piece of advice I can give to beginner players, which I used to consider myself one not too long ago, is to read, reread, and reread the Player’s Handbook.
