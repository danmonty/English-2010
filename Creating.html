                My older brother introduced me to Dungeons and Dragons. He wanted to try being the Dungeon Master and wanted some test subjects. My cousin and I were some of his first victims. He printed off the character sheets for us and gave us the Player’s Handbook and told us to start reading and following the instructions it gives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Erubadhron, known as Eru only to those he considered his closest friends and worse enemies,  was my first creation. I was a forest gnome wizard. This was my first great mistake. First of all, magic is complicated to any noobs. There are spell lists, spell components, schools of magic, arcane focuses, and rituals. I didn’t understand Hit Die or the difference between them and my Hit Points. What gave me such complications to an otherwise simple task? I had no experience in making characters or playing D&D. This leads to my second and third great mistakes: at that point in time, I didn’t completely read any of the Player’s Handbook; and I didn’t understand most of D&D. I used Eru for about 2 sessions when I realized my ignorance created too many blunders with his making, so I decided to start my collection of failed characters—holding onto false hope that one day I will remake him.

                You may find yourself in a similar pinch that I was in. You may just have an unfortunate lack of talent for creating good, fun characters. If so, this article is here to help. However, this is not step by step for  making a D&D character: rather, a few tips and tricks to transform poor or good characters into great characters.

                Step One: Basic is Okay
            </p1>
            <p>
                According to a Wizards of the Coast (producers of D&D) survey, Human Fighters are the most played. Yes, it is simple, but it is okay. This I push for the beginner players, mostly because it can start them off and give them invaluable experience. Another suggestion for keeping it basic is to avoid heavy magic classes. Clerics, Druids, Sorcerers, Warlocks, and Wizards should probably be avoided just because magic is complex. The concept of magic and all it includes makes making characters more difficult, along with choosing and reading up on spells which also complicates characters. Remember to keep it basic.

                Step Two: Make them Unique
            </p1>
            <p>
                The best way to create and play a great character—besides with keeping true to your character—is to make them memorable. One way to do this is to make them unique. Don’t be too basic. Don’t copy and paste, making paper dolls. The characters you make can be an extension of you. Making characters unique can be difficult because there isn’t a formula for making characters unique. That would make them non-unique. However, to the amuater here are some suggestions: have an interesting backstory; have a serious or strange flaws, ideals, or bonds; have a defining physical traits; if you are role playing more in depth, try having a fun voice. But one thing to keep in the back of your mind is to make a character that you will be able to play. Don’t make them too ridiculous.
            </p>
            <p1>
                Step Three: Talk to your Dungeon Master
            </p1>
            <p>
                I give this suggestion twofold. First, usually the DM will have more experience then the beginners. They will have insight that you might not have if you are a new character. The second reason being, they can help you keep the rules, and they won’t be too surprised. Also by doing this they can help integrate characters into the campaign, which helps game flow and keeps interests high.
            </p>
            <p1>
                Step Four: Make them Applicable
            </p1>
            <p>
                This goes along with step three. The best characters are characters that are playable and useful. If the quest you will be questing through swamps and forests, don’t make a character that specializes in frozen tundras. If the main bad guy is resistant or immune to all piercing and slashing damage, a barbarian or fighter may not be the most useful. Now I don’t want you to create the perfect character, aka the Mary Sue. Mary Sue characters are perfect. The have beautiful skin, flaxen hair, and deep entrancing eyes. Their flaws are being to perfect or kind. These characters (while fun one in a donzen) can get boring to play. 
            </p>

                Step Five: Know your Character
            </p1>
            <p>
                When making a character, you should keep in mind that you will need to be playing this character. Make sure while creating your backstory, ideals, flaws, and bonds that you remember why. These are critical to role playing. The Folk Hero is going to treat villagers differently then the Bounty Hunter. Also know your characters abilities, actions, and options. Although D&D sessions can on average range from 4-8 hours, nobody wants to wait for you to flip through the Player’s Handbook looking for what your Action Surge does or what effects you can cast with Prestidigitation. I myself, am working to be better at this. I like to try to play strategy and use obscure rules or side effects to change the game. While it makes it fun to play differently from whacking and bashing, it can be a bit tedious for the other players to watch me thumb through the rule book. The biggest piece of advice I can give to beginner players, which I used to consider myself one not too long ago, is to read, reread, and reread the Player’s Handbook.
