                    My older brother introduced me to Dungeons and Dragons. He wanted to try being the Dungeon Master and needed some test subjects: my cousin and I, some of his first victims. He printed off character sheets for us and gave us the Player’s Handbook and told us to start reading and following the instructions it gives. I created my first character right then.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img class="pics2" src="..\Pictures\eru.jpg" alt="My drawing of Eru">
                    Erubadhron—known as Eru only to those he considered his closest friends and worse enemies—was my first creation. I was a forest-gnome wizard. This was my first great mistake. First of all, magic is complicated to any novice. There are spell lists and spell components and schools of magic and arcane or divine focuses and ritual spell tags. Magic wasn’t the only issue: I didn’t understand Initiative, Saving Rolls, Attack Rolls, Damage Rolls, Hit Die or the difference between them and my Hit Points. What gave me such complications to an otherwise simple task? I had no experience in making characters or playing D&D.             
                </p>
                <p>
                    This leads to my second and third great mistakes: at that point in time, I didn’t completely read any of the Player’s Handbook, and I didn’t understand most of D&D. I used Eru for about 2 sessions when I realized my ignorance created too many blunders with his making. I decided to start my collection of failed characters—holding onto false hope that one day I will remake him.

                    You may find yourself in a similar pinch that I was in. You may just have an unfortunate lack of talent for creating great, fun characters. If so, this article is here to help. However, this is not step by step for making a D&D character: rather, a few tips and tricks to transform poor or good characters into great characters.

                    Step One: Basic is Okay
                </p2>
                <p>
                    According to a Wizards of the Coast (producers of D&D) survey, the human fighter is the most played. Yes, they’re basic, but that’s the point. Avoid magic-immersive classes like clerics, druids, sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards until you have a better grip on the the components of magic. Fighters, rogues are barbarians are all great choices as low-magic characters. Remember to keep it basic.
                </p>
                <p2>
                    Step Two: Make them Unique
                </p2>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <img class="createPics" src="..\Pictures\sola.jpg" alt="My drawing of Sola">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        One way to do this is to make them unique. Don’t be too basic. Don’t make paper dolls. The characters you make are extensions of you. Making unique characters proves difficult because there isn’t a formula for making characters unique. However, here are some suggestions: have an interesting backstory; have serious or strange flaws, ideals, or bonds; have a defining physical trait; if you want to role play more in depth, try using a different voice.             
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As wizard loosely based on Eru, Sola Lureo, was a strong-willed, speak before you think, kind of rock-gnome. She ended with the other failed characters eventually because she died at the fault of the DM (what? I’m not being salty). While alive, it was fun to be sassy, even if that got us in some trouble. But remember, make your character playable            
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p2>
                    Step Three: Talk to your Dungeon Master
                </p2>
                <p>
                    I give this suggestion twofold. First, usually the DM will have more experience then the beginners with insight that you might not have. The second reason being, they can help you keep (or break...shhh) the rules, and they won’t be too surprised when you present a crazy (like multiclassing 7 times) character or use some obscure ability. Also by doing this they can help integrate characters into the campaign, helping the game flow while keeping interests high.            
                </p>
                <p2>
                    Step Four: Make them Applicable
                </p2>
                <p>
                    The best characters are characters that are playable and useful. If the quest you will be questing through swamps and forests, don’t make a character that specializes in frozen tundras. If the main bad guys are resistant or immune to all piercing and slashing damage, a barbarian or fighter may not be the most useful. Now I don’t want you to create the perfect character, aka the Mary Sue. They have beautiful skin, flaxen hair, and deep entrancing eyes. Their flaws are being too perfect or kind. These characters (while fun one in a dozen) are lame!            
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another character I made, whose final resting place is in my collection of failed characters, failed because I chose the wrong class for the campaign. His name as Kaens; Kaens was a high-elf rogue. He didn’t fail because he was too basic or not unique enough—he was raised by wolves. He failed because rogues flourish in dark dungeons and small city alleyways, not in a swampy marshland.            
                </p>
                <p2>
                    Step Five: Know your Character
                </p2>
                <p>
                    When making a character, you should keep in mind that you will need to be playing this character. Remember backstory, ideals, flaws, and bonds. These are critical to role playing. The Folk Hero is going to treat villagers differently then the Bounty Hunter. Please, know your characters abilities, actions, and options. Although D&D sessions can on average range from 4-8 hours, nobody wants to wait for you to flip through the Player’s Handbook looking for what your Action Surge does or what effects you can cast with Prestidigitation.             
                </p>
                <p>
                    I myself, am working to be better at this. I like to use strategy, but it leads to lots of rule checking. It it tedious for the other players to watch me thumb through the rule book. The biggest piece of advice I can give to beginner players, which I used to consider myself one not too long ago, is to read, reread, and reread the Player’s Handbook.
