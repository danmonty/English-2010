            <p>
                    One basic building block of a character is their class. In the <i>Players Handbook</i>, it says, “Class is the primary definition of what your character can do” (chapter 3, page 45). A players class can greatly impact how players will play because it "shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it” (<i>Players Handbook</i>, page 45). The main differences in the classes are the amount of magic, if any, they can use, and their skills with certain weapons. On one side of the spectrum, you have wizards and sorcerers using primarily magic. Barbarians and fighters, on the other hand, only use melee and ranged weapons. In each class, you can further diversify: this is called subclassing. These will give specialized skills and can help develop a more detailed backstory.
                </p>      
            <p>
                Now defining the classes as best or worst can be difficult. I admit that in my list there are definitely bias opinions. Every campaign or adventure will be unique, requiring different skills and proficiencies. However, these ranking are in part of how diverse and how well the class plays with other classes. I will try not to use subclasses to define a class since that would be to complicated, especially with all of the extra content that has been published (like Xanthar’s or Volo’s Guides). This is just a personal opinion with a pinch of facts.

                            Now this choice definitely comes with some biases and some important conditions. I personally think that if you are going to play as character based on magic, sorcerer is the way to go. Some of the downfalls of heavy magic classes are that they usually give low armor class and even lower health. However, being a sorcerer, specifically subclassing with Draconic Bloodline, it overcomes the weaknesses. You gain more hit points and can get a higher armor class. Sorcerer’s special ability lies in what is called sorcery points. The points let you modify spells so they can be cast quicker, further, or better to name a few. I personally really like this since it causes spells to be worth more per spell slot used.

                            I can not stand druids! They are like the hippies of the D&D world. I have bad experiences with druids, mostly with them being absolutely worthless. However, they have some cool abilities. One, they can transform into different animals giving them larger pools of hit points which can make them tanky. They also have a spell casting focus, making it easier to cast better spells. Unfortunately, I think that the pros don’t outweigh the cons. Druids are practically less religious clerics or more magical rangers. Most classes have a good balance of martial or magic training, but druids seem to get shorthanded in both since the other one is supposed to balance it out.

                            Rangers are great because they are well balanced. They are great with weapons, yet, they can use magic quiet efficiently. Most of their available spells are not offensive, but used more to buff yourself or others. One of the rangers most useful abilities is dexterity. Dexterity is part of determining armor class and initiative. The higher it is, the hard it is to be hit and the faster you can go. Rangers can use dexterity for attacks as well, meaning that they don’t need to worry about having as high of ability scores in more abilities.                         </p>

                            Now this is mostly situational, but I think Rogues are not good at all. What I mean by situation is that Rogues have their time and place, being in the slums of  large towns or the dark of  narrow dungeons, but most of the campaigns I have played don’t favor the rogues or their class abilities. I’ll admit that there have been many aplenty times that I wished we had a rogue in the group, so they could pick a lock or pickpocket a noble, but most of those times, having a barbarian to do some heavy hitting handles the situation just fine. Another kicker is that they don’t have magic unless they subclass, and even then, their magic isn’t good.

                            It was a difficult battle between clerics or rangers for first place. The thing that set it over the edge however, was that clerics, even though less focused on martial skills, are a bit more focused on magic. In my opinion, I like magic more than I like weapons. Magic can allow for more creativity with solving problems and winning battles because you have more of a choice than, “I swing my sword...again”. Clerics spell lists is bigger than the rangers, with better buff, and offensive magic; they also have a spell-casting-focus (a wand, staff, amulet, etc.), making it easier for them to cast higher level spells. Clerics’ subclassing options also give a wide variety of skills allowing them to be useful in most situations.

                                I’ll admit it: I have enjoyed playing a monk before. They use dexterity for attacks, they have good options for subclassing in general, and they can have high hitpoints and armor class. I just think that they make the game less enjoyable. Overcompensating for the lack of magic, they have special skills on almost every level, they are too OP, and their turns can take way too long using bonus actions and special abilities over and over again. So while they are fun to play, they can start to bring the game down.

                    You may be wondering what I think about the other classes, so here is the rating from best to worst:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Clerics</li>
                    <li>Rangers</li>
                    <li>Sorcerers</li>
                    <li>Bards</li>
                    <li>Barbarians</li>
                    <li>Fighters</li>
                    <li>Wizards</li>
                    <li>Warlocks</li>
                    <li>Paladins</li>
                    <li>Druids</li>
                    <li>Rogues</li>
                    <li>Monks</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Even though I just ranked the classes, I think they can all be good options for different situations. D&D isn’t always about being the best. If everyone was a cleric, there might be some issues. There are also many different things that I didn’t rank. Power level in general, playability or fun. D&D is a game, meaning players should have fun playing. If everyone wants to be a bard, let them! I think that moderation is a great policy, but I have a magic-heavy class in the top three while a balanced class in the bottom three. All classes have a time and place: D&D is just finding the best (or worst) times to use a class.
