            <p1 class="title">The Best and Worst Classes</p1>
            <p>
                If you are a brand-spanking new Dungeon and Dragon player, this may seem like a strange place to start. You may not know anything and this might be a little confusing. Stay with me, use the <a href="terms.html">Terms</a> page for words you don’t understand. Class is a huge part of making and shaping your beloved characters. Let’s dive in!
            </p>
            <p>
                The basic building block of a character is their class. The Player’s Handbook says, “Class is the primary definition of what your character can do” (pg 45). Class will greatly impact characters because it  "shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it” (Players Handbook, pg 45). The main differences between classes are the amount of magic they can use, and their level of skills with weapons. On one side of the spectrum, wizards and sorcerers use primarily magic. On the other side, barbarians and fighters rely on melee and ranged weapons. In each class, you can further diversify: this is called subclassing. These will give specialized skills and can help develop a more detailed backstory.
            </p>      
            <p>
                Now defining the classes as best or worst is difficult. I admit that in my list there are definitely bias opinions. Because every campaign or adventure will be unique, requiring different skills and proficiencies, the rankings (which will be bias) will be loosely based on my personal experiences. However, these ranking use diversity of classes and how well they work in a team. I won’t go specifically into subclasses too much (that would be too complicated, especially with all of the extra content that has been published like Xanthar’s or Volo’s Guides). This is just a personal opinion with a pinch of facts.            </p>

                            Bias alert: I love sorcerers. If you are going to play as character based on magic, sorcerer is the way to go. The sorcerer’s special ability lies with in its sorcery points. The points let you modify spells so they can be cast quicker, further, better, or safer. By modifying spells, it makes them worth more per spell slot. The Draconic Bloodline subclass is also really good, helping with the usual low armor class and lower health.                        </p>

                            I cannot stand druids! They equate as the hippies of the D&D world. I have bad experiences with druids, mostly with them being absolutely worthless. However, they have some cool abilities. One, they can transform into different animals giving them larger pools of hit points. They have a spell casting focus, making it easier to cast the better spells. Unfortunately, druids are just less religious clerics or more magical rangers. Most classes have a good balance of martial or magic training, but druids are shorthanded on both sides.                        </p>

                            Rangers are great because they are well balanced. They are great with weapons, yet, they can use magic quiet efficiently. Most of their available spells are not offensive, but used more to buff yourself or others. One of the rangers most useful abilities is dexterity. Dexterity is part of determining armor class and initiative. The higher it is, the hard it is to be hit and the faster you can go. Rangers can use dexterity for attacks as well, meaning that they don’t need to worry about having as high of ability scores in more abilities.                         </p>

                            Rogues have their time and place, being in the slums of large towns or the dark and narrow hallways of dungeons, but most of the campaigns I have played don’t favor the rogues’ class abilities. There have been many aplenty times that I wished we had a rogue in the group (to pick a lock or pickpocket a noble), but most of those times, either having a barbarian to do some heavy hitting or a wizard to blow stuff up handles the situation just fine.

                            Clerics, like rangers, are well balanced between magic and weapons. But they are usually more magic leaning. I like magic more than I like weapons because magic allows for more creativity. The clerics’ spell list is longer than the rangers, including offensive and defensive magic; they also have a spell casting focus (a wand, staff, amulet, etc.), making it easier for them to cast higher level spells. Clerics’ subclassing options also give a wide variety of skills allowing them to be useful in most situations.

                                I’ll admit it: I have enjoyed playing a monk before. They use dexterity for attacks, and they have good options for subclassing in general. They can have high hitpoints and armor class. They just make the game less enjoyable. Overcompensating for the lack of magic, they have special skills on almost every level making them too OP, and their turns can take way too long using bonus actions and special abilities over and over again. So while they are fun to play, they are a bore to the rest of the party.                            </p>

                    You may be wondering what I think about the other classes, so here is the rating from best to worst:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Clerics</li>
                    <li>Rangers</li>
                    <li>Sorcerers</li>
                    <li>Bards</li>
                    <li>Barbarians</li>
                    <li>Fighters</li>
                    <li>Wizards</li>
                    <li>Warlocks</li>
                    <li>Paladins</li>
                    <li>Druids</li>
                    <li>Rogues</li>
                    <li>Monks</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                        Even though I just ranked the classes, I think they can all be good options for different situations. D&D isn’t about being the best. If everyone was a cleric, it would be silly but ruin the fun creativity of D&D. There are also other things I didn’t take into consideration. Damage output, playability, or fun. D&D is a game. Players should have fun playing. If everyone wants to be a bard, let them! I think that moderation is a great policy, but I have a magic-heavy class in the top three while a balanced class in the bottom three. All classes have a time and place: D&D is just finding the best (or worst) times to use a class.
