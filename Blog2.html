            <p1 class="title">The Ridiculousness of Criticalness</p1>
            <p2 class="addDate">Posted October 2nd 2018</p2>
            <p4>Some Important Background Information:</p4>
            <p>
                My party and I were attacked by a Dragon. We enter a keep nearby and were sent on a quest to rescue a Monk who was kidnapped by the Cult of Dragons. My party consisted of myself, Sula, a rock-gnome wizard, Rune, a dragonborn paladin, Stella, a halfling ranger, Ellan, a drow rogue, and Aulbirch, a dwarven druid. We ambushed some cultist outside of the camp and stole some robes. We needed to find where they kept the prisoners so Rune and I brought Stella as a prisoner into the camp while Ellan and Birch waited outside to either help us or recieve the Monk. Well, things didn’t go as planned...which usually sums up D&D.
            </p>
            <p4>Now the Story:</p4>
            <p>
                    We both got into the camp without any trouble. When Rune started asking questions about where to take the prisoner, he needed to make some Deception rolls successfully lie. That didn’t work out when he got a critical fail by rolling a 1 on his d20. The guards took him, along with Stella to the prison tent. I was fortunate enough to convince the guards that I was bamboozled by Rune’s treachery. The One Who Wears Purple Robes, the leader of the camp, met with Rune and Stella and sentenced them to death at sunrise the next morning. After finding out that Ellan and Birch were otherwise occupied, I knew that saving them was up to me. I while I was formulating a plan, I found out where the Monk was being kept. My first plan was to sneak them out, but that became impossible when I was assigned guard duty one the other side of camp.

            </p>
            <p>
                    Before sunrise, the Cult Leader gathered everyone for the public execution. They were to be burned alive. After his big speech, the torch bearers were about to light the piles of wood. I did the only thing I could: I cast presdidigdation and minor illusion. Alone these spells have minor effects, but used together they can make quite an impressive display. I used minor illusion to create and image of an attacking troll. I used prestidigitation to create minor effects like roaring, stomping and screaming. My DM was not impressed. He was like, “Is that what you really want to do?...Okay...ummm...roll a...lets go with a persuasion check”. I knew from past experiences that the DM was only going to allow this to happen was if I rolled a 20 on my d20. When one rolls a 20, it means that they succeed...usually no matter what. The entire party held our collective breathe while I rolled my d20. The improbable happened: I got a 20!

            </p>
            <p>
                    If there was a time when we absolutely needed a 20, now was the time. What happened next? Chaos ensued! The spells I cast sent cultist running, some towards, some away. I kept up the spells and ran to my friends. I cut them lose and we ran towards where the Monk was kept. As we ran I cast firebolt to and fro, burning as many tents as I could, hoping that the chaos would keep us out of mind. We rescued the Monk and continued running. 

            </p>
            <p>
                    We successfully made it out and rescued the Monk. To this day, I have never been as lucky as that day. Welcome to the silliness of D&D.
